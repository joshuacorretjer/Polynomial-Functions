# Proyect-1-DT-FALL-2020

The following repository contains the starting code for the first project.

For testing purposes please DO NOT CHANGE JUNIT TESTERS. Adjust your methods names to those of the testers so that when other testers are used in your code there is no failure related to that issue.

Use Polynomial.PolynomialImp as the name of the class (as described in the JUnit tests) to implement your solution. 

In order to grade your solution and be considered a "working code", it must past Test1.
